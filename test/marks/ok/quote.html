<h2>Syntax: TAB defines quote</h2>

	<blockquote>
	To quote a paragraph, just prefix it by a TAB
	character. All the lines of the paragraph must
	begin with a TAB.
	</blockquote>
<p>
Any non-tabbed line closes the quote block.
</p>

<h2>Nesting: Creating deeper quotes</h2>

	<blockquote>
	The number of leading TABs identifies the quote
	block depth. This is quote level 1.
		<blockquote>
		With two TABs, we are on the quote
		level 2.
			<blockquote>
			The more TABs, more deep is
			the quote level.
				<blockquote>
				There isn't a limit.
				</blockquote>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>

<h2>Nesting: Reverse nesting works</h2>

	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote>
				This quote starts at
				level 4.
				</blockquote>
			Then its depth is decreased.
			</blockquote>
		Counting down, one by one.
		</blockquote>
	Until the level 1.
	</blockquote>

<h2>Nesting: Random count</h2>

	<blockquote>
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
			Unlike lists, any quote block is
			independent, not part of a tree.
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
	The TAB count don't need to be incremental
	by one.
		<blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote>
				The nesting don't need
				to follow any rule.
				</blockquote>
			</blockquote>
		Quotes can be opened and closed
		in any way.
			<blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					<blockquote>
					You choose.
					</blockquote>
				</blockquote>
			</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>

<h2>Nesting: When not supported</h2>

	<blockquote>
	Some targets (as sgml) don't support the
	nesting of quotes. There is only one quote
	level.
		<blockquote>
		In this case, no matter how much
		TABs are used to define the quote
		block, it always will be level 1.
		</blockquote>
	</blockquote>

<h2>Syntax: Spaces after TAB</h2>

	<blockquote>
	  Spaces AFTER the TAB character are allowed.
	  But be careful, it can be confusing.
	</blockquote>

<h2>Invalid: Spaces before TAB</h2>

<p>
  	Spaces BEFORE the TAB character
  	invalidate the mark. It's not quote.
</p>

<h2>Invalid: Paragraphs inside</h2>

	<blockquote>
	Paragraph breaks inside a quote aren't
	possible.
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
	This sample are two separated quoted
	paragraphs, not a quote block with
	two paragraphs inside.
	</blockquote>

<h2>Closing: EOF closes the open block</h2>

	<blockquote>
	The end of the file (EOF) closes the
	currently open quote block.
	</blockquote>
